<Note>
  This guide uses Paraglide JS v2, which significantly simplifies the setup compared to v1. The built-in middleware and runtime functions eliminate the need for custom server functions and hooks that were required in earlier versions.
</Note>

## Why Paraglide?

While there are many i18n solutions available like react-i18next, FormatJS, and others, Paraglide JS stands out by offering a more modern, type-safe approach to internationalization. Here are the key benefits:

- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with compile-time checks for missing translations and parameters
- **Performance**: Zero runtime overhead through compile-time optimizations and tree-shaking
- **Developer Experience**: Excellent IDE support with inline previews and real-time validation
- **Modern Tooling**: Part of the [inlang](https://inlang.com/) ecosystem with AI-powered suggestions and automated workflows

## Getting Started

Before diving into Paraglide, let's set up a fresh TanStack Start project. If you already have an existing project, just skip this.

First, create a new TanStack Start project using the official CLI:

```bash
npm create @tanstack/start@latest
```

For this guide, I've chosen a clean, minimal setup with Tailwind CSS and Biome as the toolchain, without any add-ons or examples. Feel free to adjust these options based on your preferences.

Once created, navigate to your project and start the dev server:

```bash
cd start-basic
npm run dev
```

### Setting Up Paraglide

With our project ready, we can now add Paraglide. We'll set it up with English (`en`) and German (`de`) as our languages.

Run the initialization command:

```bash
npx @inlang/paraglide-js@latest init
```

The CLI will guide you through setup with several prompts:

1. **Uncommitted changes** - Recommends committing your work first (you can proceed anyway)
2. **Compiled files location** - Where to place generated files (default: `./src/paraglide`)
3. **TypeScript configuration** - Verifies `compilerOptions.allowJs: true` in `tsconfig.json`
4. **VS Code extension** - Adds Sherlock extension recommendation for inline translation previews
5. **Machine translations** - Enable AI-powered auto-translations (optional, we'll skip for manual control)

The init command automatically:
- Installs `@inlang/paraglide-js` to devDependencies
- Creates `project.inlang/` directory with your i18n configuration
- Creates `messages/` with example translation files (`en.json`, `de.json`)
- Adds the Vite plugin to `vite.config.ts`
- Compiles initial translations to the output directory

After initialization completes, you'll find the plugin added to `vite.config.ts`. To enable cookie-based language persistence and detection, update the plugin configuration with the following options:

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import { tanstackStart } from '@tanstack/react-start/plugin/vite'
import viteReact from '@vitejs/plugin-react'
import { paraglideVitePlugin } from '@inlang/paraglide-js'

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    paraglideVitePlugin({
      project: './project.inlang',
      outdir: './src/paraglide',
      outputStructure: 'message-modules',
      cookieName: 'PARAGLIDE_LOCALE',
      strategy: ['cookie', 'preferredLanguage', 'baseLocale'],
    }),
    tanstackStart(),
    viteReact(),
  ],
})
```

These configuration options enable:
- `outputStructure: 'message-modules'` - Cleaner import syntax for messages
- `cookieName: 'PARAGLIDE_LOCALE'` - Persists language selection across sessions
- `strategy: ['cookie', 'preferredLanguage', 'baseLocale']` - Language detection priority (cookie → browser preference → default)

<Note>
  By excluding "url" from the strategy array, we keep URLs clean without locale prefixes (e.g., `/about` instead of `/en/about`). This is ideal for applications where multi-locale SEO isn't a primary concern.
</Note>

### Creating Your First Translations

Paraglide uses a flat JSON structure for translations. The init command already created a `messages/` directory with example files. Let's customize them with our own messages.

Update `messages/en.json`:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://inlang.com/schema/inlang-message-format",
  "hello": "Hello, world!",
  "greeting": "Hey {name}, how are you?"
}
```

Update `messages/de.json`:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://inlang.com/schema/inlang-message-format",
  "hello": "Hallo, Welt!",
  "greeting": "Hey {name}, wie geht's dir?"
}
```

Parameters in curly braces (like `{name}`) become required function parameters in your TypeScript code, providing compile-time safety. The Vite plugin watches these files and automatically recompiles when you make changes.

### Using Translations in Your Application

Now that we have our translations set up, let's create a new route to demonstrate how to use them. First, start your development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Create a new route file at `src/routes/hello.tsx`:

```tsx
import { createFileRoute } from '@tanstack/react-router'
import { m } from '@/paraglide/messages'

export const Route = createFileRoute('/hello')({
  component: HelloRoute,
})

function HelloRoute() {
  return (
    <div className="p-4">
      {/* Simple message without parameters */}
      <h1 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">{m.hello()}</h1>

      {/* Message with required parameter */}
      <p>{m.greeting({ name: 'Eugene' })}</p>
    </div>
  )
}
```

Thanks to Paraglide's type safety, your IDE will show errors if you:
- Try to use a message that doesn't exist
- Forget to provide required parameters
- Pass parameters with the wrong type

<Note>
  The `outputStructure: "message-modules"` option in our Vite config enables this clean import syntax. All your translations are available through the `m` object with full TypeScript support.
</Note>

### Configure Language Detection

Paraglide's Vite plugin generates server middleware that automatically handles language detection. The middleware checks for a saved language preference in cookies, falls back to the browser's language settings, and finally defaults to your base locale.

Create `src/server.ts` to set up the middleware:

```typescript
import { paraglideMiddleware } from './paraglide/server.js'
import handler from '@tanstack/react-start/server-entry'

export default {
  fetch(req: Request): Promise<Response> {
    return paraglideMiddleware(req, ({ request }) => handler.fetch(request))
  },
}
```

The middleware intercepts all requests and:
1. Reads the `PARAGLIDE_LOCALE` cookie if it exists
2. Falls back to the `Accept-Language` header from the browser
3. Defaults to your base locale (English in our case)

This happens automatically on every request, ensuring the correct language is always detected.

### Create Language Switcher

Now let's build a component that allows users to switch between languages. Create `src/components/LanguageSwitcher.tsx`:

```tsx
import { getLocale, locales, setLocale } from '@/paraglide/runtime'

export function LanguageSwitcher() {
  return (
    <div className="flex gap-2">
      {locales.map((locale) => (
        <button
          key={locale}
          onClick={() => setLocale(locale)}
          className={`px-3 py-1 rounded border ${
            locale === getLocale()
              ? 'bg-blue-500 text-white border-blue-600'
              : 'bg-gray-100 text-gray-700 border-gray-300 hover:bg-gray-200'
          }`}
        >
          {locale.toUpperCase()}
        </button>
      ))}
    </div>
  )
}
```

This component:
- Maps over all available `locales` from the Paraglide runtime
- Uses `getLocale()` to check which language is currently active
- Calls `setLocale(locale)` to switch languages (automatically updates the cookie)
- Highlights the active language with different styling

### Wire It All Together

Finally, update your root route to use the language switcher and set the HTML `lang` attribute. Update `src/routes/__root.tsx`:

```tsx
import { HeadContent, Scripts, createRootRoute } from '@tanstack/react-router'
import { TanStackRouterDevtoolsPanel } from '@tanstack/react-router-devtools'
import { TanStackDevtools } from '@tanstack/react-devtools'
import { getLocale } from '@/paraglide/runtime'

import { LanguageSwitcher } from '../components/LanguageSwitcher'

export const Route = createRootRoute({
  head: () => ({
    meta: [
      {
        charSet: 'utf-8',
      },
      {
        name: 'viewport',
        content: 'width=device-width, initial-scale=1',
      },
      {
        title: 'TanStack Start Starter',
      },
    ],
  }),
  shellComponent: RootDocument,
})

function RootDocument({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <html lang={getLocale()}>
      <head>
        <HeadContent />
      </head>
      <body>
        <div className="p-4 border-b">
          <LanguageSwitcher />
        </div>

        {children}

        <TanStackDevtools position="bottom-right" />
        <Scripts />
      </body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

Key points:
- `<html lang={getLocale()}>` dynamically sets the page language for accessibility and SEO
- The `LanguageSwitcher` is placed in the root layout, making it available on all pages
- When a user switches languages, `setLocale()` updates the cookie and triggers a re-render with the new language

That's it! Your application now has full language detection and switching capabilities with just a few lines of code.

## Developer Experience

### VS Code Integration

The Paraglide CLI automatically configures VS Code to suggest the Sherlock extension. After running `npm create @inlang/paraglide-js@latest init`, you'll find a `.vscode/extensions.json` file in your project recommending the extension.

<Hint href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=inlang.vs-code-extension">
  Install Sherlock from VS Code marketplace
</Hint>

Once installed, the extension provides:

- **Inline translation previews** - See translations directly in your code
- **One-click message extraction** - Add new translations without switching files
- **Quick editing** - Update translations inline without opening JSON files

This makes working with translations seamless - you can see and edit everything without leaving your code. Combined with TypeScript's type safety catching missing translations at compile time, you get a robust development experience.

## Limitations and Considerations

While Paraglide JS offers many advantages, it has some limitations to consider:

- **Runtime Flexibility**: Translations are compiled at build time, so dynamic loading isn't possible. This mainly affects content-heavy sites like blogs or e-commerce platforms that need translations from a database or CMS. Most CMSs have their own translation systems you can use instead.
- **Ecosystem Maturity**: Being newer than alternatives, some advanced features are still in development. Version 2 will add pluralization and gender support, and the ecosystem is actively growing with regular updates.
- **Build Time Overhead**: The compilation step adds a small build overhead, though it's usually negligible.

## Wrapping Up

Throughout this guide, we've explored integrating Paraglide JS with TanStack Start to create a modern, type-safe internationalization system. We've covered:

- Setting up Paraglide JS in a TanStack Start project
- Creating and managing translations with full type safety
- Implementing language detection and switching
- Leveraging VS Code extensions for better DX
- Understanding and working with lint rules

Paraglide JS stands out for its strong developer experience, type safety, and performance - key features for modern React projects. Its compile-time optimizations and tooling support make it particularly effective for teams building maintainable applications.

If you're starting a new project or looking to modernize your i18n setup, give Paraglide JS a try.
